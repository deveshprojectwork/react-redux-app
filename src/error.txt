    solution
    remove below 
      return{
             ...state, ////used to preserve the value
             cname:action.payload
         }##
    
    replace 
    return action.cname

    error 2:
    Ã—
Unhandled Rejection (Error): Given action "CHANGE_NAME", reducer "cname" returned undefined. 
To ignore an action, you must explicitly return the previous state. 
If you want this reducer to hold no value, you can return null instead of undefined.
solution 
return action.payload
